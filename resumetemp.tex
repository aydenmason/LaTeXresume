\subsection{Cigna\hfill\mdseries July 2021 - Present}


 \item[] \textit{Software Engineer [JavaScript, Python, pgSQL, Bash, Node.js]}
\item Developed features for ‘The Doctor’ which is an internally used automation tool mainly used for scheduling tasks and generating reports. Interfaced with customers, forlumated roadmapping,  provided analysis based on timelines, and followed CI/CD pipeline.
\item Product owner of automated ETL process for survey data that comes in from various sources such as mySQL, Verint, Qualtrics.
\item Lead automation process of PostgreSQL configuration when a new VM is deployed for 'The Doctor'. The  purpose of this is to quickly change the database to store its data on the NAS rather than locally on the VM. This was important not only for saving around 10\% space per VM, but it also insured the team had access to the pgSQL data incase the VM instance went down.
\item Won enterprise-wide hackathon in 2022: Sentiment analysis on social media posts mentioning Cigna.\\
